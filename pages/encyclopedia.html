        <h2>Journey to the Abyss : The 5 layers of the ocean</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The ocean is far more than a vast expanse of blue water; it is a facinating vertical world. As you descend, sunlight fades, temperature plummet, and pressure becomes staggering. Discover the five distinct strata that make up our planet's final frontier.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>The Epipelagic Zone (0-200m)</h4>
        The Sunlight Zone - This is the surface layer where the sun shines brightest. It is the heart of marine life: through photosynthesis, algae and plankton provide the foundation for a massive food web, from schools of tuna to majestic sharks. This is the warmest and most biodiverse region on Earth. 
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>The Mesopelagic Zone (200-1000m)</h4>
        <p>The Twilight Zone - Here, the sun's rays begin to fade into a mysterious, deep blue. It is too dark for plants to grow, making this the realm of strange creatures with oversized eyes. This is where bioluminesence first appears, creatures that produce their own light to hunt. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>The Bathypelagic Zone (1000-4000m)</h4>
        <p>The Midnight Zone - In this vast layer, darkness is absolute. The pressure here is so intense it would crush a standard submarine. The animals living in this icy desert, such as the famous Fangtooth fish, have slow metabolisms and specialized bodies designed to survive in a world without light.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>The Abyssopelagic Zone - (4000-6000m)</h4>
        <p>Named after the Greek word "Abyssos", meaning "bottomless", this zone covers the majority of the ocean floor. It is a world of perpetual silence, covered in fine "marine snow", organic debris falling from the layers above. Despite the near-freezing temperatures, resilient lives forms like sea cucumbers and tripod fish thrive here. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>The Hadalpelagic Zone (6000m and deeper)</h4>
        <p>The trenches of Hades - Found only in the deepest oceans trenches, this is the most hostile environment on Earth. Named after Hades, the god of the underworld, it includes the Mariana Trench (11 034 meters deep). Even at these crushing depths, gelatinous fish and microorganism prove that life truly knows no limits.  </p>
